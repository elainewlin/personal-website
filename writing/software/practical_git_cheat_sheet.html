        Do you want to improve your git skills? Do you ever struggle with merge conflicts, giant
        changes, or mysterious errors?
      </p>
      <p>
        I learned how to use git from a few years of working in tech. This is a practical git cheat
        sheet you can reference for many situations. I go over:

      <p>
        Git is a version control system. Developers use version control to track and manage changes
        to software. Version control is like Google docs. Both let you to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Collaborate on projects without emailing files back and forth.</li>
        <li>Track changes to a project by viewing the version history.</li>
        <li>Make copies of a project.</li>
        <li>Work offline and sync your changes when you're back online.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For example, <code>git log</code> is like Google Docs version history. You can see and
        restore previous snapshots of your progress. To do so:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>In Google Docs, click on a previous version.</li>
        <li>In git, <code>git checkout</code> a previous commit.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Learn basic git terminology to have a good mental model of what's going on. Here are some
        common terms you'll see:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Terminal (aka command line, console):</b> You can use the terminal to talk to a
          computer by typing commands instead of moving the mouse. Learn to use git via the terminal
          instead of relying on user interfaces - it's faster and gives you more control. See
          <a href="#terminal-101">Terminal 101</a> for more details.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Repository (aka repo):</b> A repository is a virtual storage of a project. It's a big
          folder with lots of smaller folders and files. Each project typically has its own
          repository.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <b>git branches and commits</b>

          width="600"
          alt="A diagram of the git branching workflow. There are 2 features: feature branch A and feature branch B. They split off from the master branch and then merge back into it."
        />
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Branch:</b> A project has many branches. Branches let developers to work on different
          parts of the same project in parallel.
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>The primary branch is called the <code>master</code> or <code>main</code> branch.</li>
          <li>You can create a feature branch off of the <code>master</code> branch.</li>
          <li>
            Then, you merge the feature branch into <code>master</code> when the feature branch is
            good to go.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          <b>Commit:</b> A commit is a snapshot of a branch at the time of commit. You make commits
          on a branch to keep track of progress. Each circle in the diagram is a commit.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Commit hash (aka commit SHA):</b> A commit hash is the unique ID for any commit in your
          project. It looks something like b6194c7fcbb11f3c250536425c67b45779458a59. By default, git
          sets the first 7 characters as a short commit hash i.e. b6194c7. Commands that require a
          commit hash work as long as you provide the first handful of characters and those
          characters are unique. For example, the following commands do the same thing:
          <ul>
            <li><code>git checkout b6194c7fcbb11f3c250536425c67b45779458a59</code></li>
            <li><code>git checkout b6194c7fcbb11f3c25</code></li>
            <li><code>git checkout b6194c7</code></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Do <code>git add</code> to move files to the staging area and then
            <code>git commit</code> to commit changes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do <code>git reset</code> to move changes from the staging area to the working
            directory.

        <li>
          <b>Local, remote:</b> You make changes on a local copy of a repository. Developers share
          code with each other via a remote repository.
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Do <code>git push</code> your changes to a remote copy of a repository.</li>
          <li>Do <code>git pull</code> other people's changes from the remote repository.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Type these commands in the terminal. See <a href="terminal-101">Terminal 101</a> to learn
          the basics.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fill out anything in brackets. For example, to switch to the <code>master</code> branch,
          do <code>git checkout master</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use <code>git log</code> to find relevant commit hashes. Learn how
          <code>git log</code> works in your terminal. On Mac, hit Enter to scroll down and q to
          exit.

      <p>Here are some tips on git commands:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you see an error like
          <code
            >error: commit 2ecd4566cde6ffb8ce5e103eb79e971483d0eaa2 is a merge but no -m option was
            given</code
          >, adding <code>-m 1</code> will probably fix it. This lets git know which side of the
          merge should be considered the parent.
        </li>
        <li>
          When typing a commit hash, if you see an error like
          <code>error: pathspec 'b61' did not match any file(s) known to git</code>, double-check
          that you copied the commit hash correctly and provided enough characters.
        </li>
        <li>
          When typing a file path, if you see an error like
          <code>fatal: pathspec 'writin' did not match any files</code>, double-check that you typed
          the file path correctly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add <code>--no-commit</code> when you do a cherry-pick or merge if you don't want to
          commit the changes.
        </li>
        <li>Add <code>--no-verify</code> when you make a commit to bypass any pre-commit hooks.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="text-large" id="practical-git-workflows">Practical git workflows</h2>
      <p>Here are some practical git workflows I use as a software engineer:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Making a feature branch</b> lets you develop on a local copy of the project without
          messing up the primary version. Feature branches also let developers work on projects in
          parallel. Once your feature branch is good to go, you can merge it into the master branch.
          For big features, see the section on
          <a href="#big-feature-branch">managing a big feature branch</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Committing a change</b> lets you track changes as you work. Using descriptive commit
          messages helps you remember why you made particular changes. I recommend making small,
          frequent commits so you can save your progress.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Keeping a branch up-to-date</b> makes it easier for you to integrate your changes. You
          can prevent gigantic merge conflicts. This is important if you're working on a big,
          long-running feature branch. Note that it's a lot easier to use
          <code>git merge</code> instead of <code>git rebase</code>. That way, you only have to
          resolve one set of merge conflicts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Resolving merge conflicts</b> is necessary if multiple people touch the same file. See
          section below on <a href="#fix-merge-conflict">fixing a merge conflict</a> for more
          details.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Cleaning up commit history</b> on a branch can help you keep a feature branch tidy.
          Don't clean up commit history after you put a branch up for review - it's harder for a
          reviewer to see changes since their last review.
          <span class="highlight">Note that <code>git push --force</code> is dangerous</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Applying changes between two commits to a new branch</b> helps avoid merge conflicts
          and makes your code easier to review. Note that you can <code>git cherry-pick</code> each
          commit, but it is often easier to grab all changes between two commits.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Cherry-picking commits to a new branch</b> lets you merge the same set of change to
          different base branches. For example, you might make changes on a
          <code>staging</code> branch before merging into <code>master</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Reverting a change</b> is helpful when things go wrong. If a recent commit causes an
          incident, you should revert the change. The example is for reverting a change on
          <code>master</code>. If you aren't working with a protected branch, you may not need to
          create another branch for the revert.
        </li>

      <h2 class="text-large" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        When I first started programming, I struggled to install git and to set up a repository. Git
        can be confusing at first, but you'll get familiar over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        My biggest piece of advice on git is don't panic and don't blindly copy/paste commands.
        Typing random commands won't solve the problem and can make it harder to understand the
        issue. You can review the section on
        <a href="#basic-git-terminology">basic git terminology</a> and
        <a href="#common-git-commands">common git commands</a> to understand what you're doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're still confused, ask the Internet. If the first result doesn't work, ask for help.
        I've found that either the first result solves the problem or something else is going on.
        Like with a lot of software problems, you should ask for help to resolve your issue and to
        learn and grow.
      </p>

      <p>
        To use git well, you should learn how to use the terminal. To open a terminal on Mac, type
        command-space and search "terminal".
      </p>
      <p>
        I use a Mac computer and Sublime Text for a text editor. Useful commands may vary depending
        on your operating system and preferred text editor.

      <p>Here's a short reference of terminal commands:</p>

          For the <code>sublime</code> command to work, you need to download Sublime Text and follow
          the command line setup instructions. See

      <h3 class="text-medium" id="vim-101">Vim 101</h3>
      <p>Vim is a text editor in your terminal. It looks something like this:</p>
      <p class="center">
        <img src="/assets/vim-terminal.png" width="600" alt="A screenshot of the Vim terminal" />
      </p>
      <p>
        My first experience with Vim was wondering "how do I get out of this thing?". It's confusing
        at first. In the main mode, tapping on keyboard keys moves the cursor and doesn't add text.
      </p>
      <p>Vim is useful for writing git commit messages. Here's a short reference:</p>
      <table class="table">
        <thead>
          <td>What to type</td>
          <td>Usage</td>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>:q! to quit without saving</td>
            <td>Get out of vim without saving your commit message.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>i to insert</td>
            <td>Type a commit message in vim.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>esc to go back to the main mode</td>
            <td>Once you're done typing your commit message.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>:wq! to quit and save</td>

      <h3 class="text-medium" id="fix-merge-conflict">Fixing a merge conflict</h3>
      <p>
        Usually, Git can merge changes without intervention. Merge conflicts happen when Git doesn't
        know which changes to keep and asks you to help out.
      </p>
      <p>Merge conflicts look scary, but are easy to fix when you get used to it.</p>
      <p>Here's what a merge conflict looks like in the terminal:</p>
      <pre>
  Cat:personal-website elainelin$ git merge practical-git-cheat-sheet
  Auto-merging writing.html
  <span class="highlight">CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in writing.html</span>
  Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
      </pre>
      <p>
        If you read the error message, you see there's a problem with the file
        <code>writing.html</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Open the file in your text editor. Git highlights the merge conflicts with angry carats.
        Later, to make sure you've fixed all merge conflicts, you can search the repo for all
        instances of "&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;" or "&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;".
      </p>
      <pre>
  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
    &lt;table class="table post-table"&gt;
  =======
    &lt;table class="table table-borderless post-table"&gt;
      &lt;td class="post-date"&gt;May 9, 2021&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;a href="/writing/software/practical_git_cheat_sheet.html"
          &gt;Practical git cheat sheet&lt;/a
        &gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; practical-git-cheat-sheet
      </pre>
      <p>
        It's up to you to figure out which changes to keep or not. In this case, the resolution
        might look like:
      </p>
      <pre>
    &lt;table class="table post-table"&gt;
      &lt;td class="post-date"&gt;May 9, 2021&lt;/td&gt;

      <p>
        If you're working on a big feature, you can set up a big feature branch. This helps you:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Prevent gigantic PR reviews</li>
        <li>Make incremental progress</li>
        <li>Group together related changes</li>

        />
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Suppose you're working on a big feature and set up feature branch A.</li>
        <li>As you work on the feature, make branches A', A", etc. off branch A.</li>
        <li>Merge A', A", etc. into branch A.</li>
        <li>When all of the work is done, you can merge branch A into master.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Here are some example commands:</p>
