      <h2>Learning to run</h2>
      <p>
        I didn't use to run - I ran 1/2 a mile in 2020 and 0 miles in 2021. I tried running a few
        times in 2019, but couldn't get into it. There were a few reasons why:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>I felt self-conscious.</b> Most people look sweaty and disheveled when they run. As an
          inexperienced runner, I thought I would look silly and slow.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Running felt uncomfortable.</b> It was difficult to manage my pace and my breathing.
          Sometimes, I would go too fast; sometimes, I would start to hyperventilate. I felt easily
          winded.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>I had decision fatigue.</b> There are a lot of decisions to make when you go on a run:
          what route to take, how far to run, how fast to run, what to listen to. This takes up
          mental capacity.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I thought I would always dislike running, but now, I run regularly. I run 3 times a week,
        and I ran 36 miles in the past 4 weeks. Here's what helped with my running concerns.
      </p>
      <p><b>I felt self-conscious.</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Adjust your mindset.</b> Most people don't care how you look and won't comment on it.
          If you do get rude comments, you can tell them to go away and mind their own business.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Get proper workout clothes.</b> Workout clothes should feel good and enable movement.
          Running in leggings is way better than running in jeans, and cute leggings make working
          out more fun.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Running felt uncomfortable.</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Start with walking and a daily step goal.</b> The most common goal I see is 10k steps
          (~4 miles). However, that takes a lot of time, and it feels less achievable. You can start
          with a fraction of that. In 2020, I started with a daily step goal of 5k steps (~2 miles)
          a day. That let me build up a habit of walking and find my favorite walking loop. I
          gradually increased the goal, and I find that 7k steps (~3 miles) works for me.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Run slowly.</b> I used to have an internal voice saying how fast I <i>should</i> be
          running: 10 minutes/mile. I found it very uncomfortable to go that fast. At some point, I
          internalized that it's OK to run slowly. Even if you are the slowest runner, you are
          faster than everyone who isn't running. You can go at whatever pace works for you. If it's
          hard to run continuously, you can try combination run/walk plans i.e. run for 30 seconds,
          walk for 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Gradually increase mileage and frequency.</b> I did not start out running 3 times a
          week. In week one, I ran one mile once. In week two, I ran two miles once. Starting out
          slow gave me enough time to get used to running.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>I had decision fatigue.</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Run a fixed route.</b> You can plot a new route at home or walk a route before you run
          it. I have a fixed 1.2 mile loop that I walk twice every day. When I started running, I
          ran the same loop.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Sign up for a race.</b> When I pay money and commit to do something, I'm more likely to
          follow through. You can also enlist your friends to sign up for peer pressure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Follow a training plan.</b> I use the app Runkeeper, and it has
          <a
            href="https://support.runkeeper.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061616591-Runkeeper-Training-Plans"
            target="_blank"
            >customized training plans</a
          >. You can sign up for the 7-day trial before you commit to the app. For example, I'm
          following a training plan to run the SF half marathon in late July. It tells me when to
          run, how far to run, and how fast to run. As an aside, if you use Runkeeper, I recommend
          <a

            >checking your privacy settings</a
          >
          - everything is public by default.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Listen to a running playlist.</b> I used to listen to my Liked Songs on a run, but I
          find it hard to run to slower songs. Now, I listen to
          <a
            href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/21tihcxLYa57ON6r8q2d4q?si=ab495a55bd3e4a22"
            target="_blank"
            >a 150-165 BPM running playlist on Spotify</a
          >. A consistent BPM helps me maintain a pace. The BPM is speedy because taking smaller
          steps reduces stress on your legs. For more technical details, see
          <a

"
            target="_blank"
            >the Nerd Fitness post on running properly</a
          >. They recommend 170-190 BPM, but that feels a little too speedy for me.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I thought I would never liked running, but I changed my mind. Now, I think it's OK. It's
        good for me, and I'm happy running like a turtle.
