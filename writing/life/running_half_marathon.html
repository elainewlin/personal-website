      <h2>Running two half marathons</h2>
      <p>
        I have run, well, more like trotted two half marathons. I don't particularly like running. However, in 2022, for my very first race, I signed up (and paid) for the SF half. In 2023, I ran the Golden Gate Half.
      </p>
      <p>  
        Prior to the SF half, I didn't run - I ran half a mile in 2020 and zero miles in 2021. I tried running a few times in 2019, but couldn't get into it. There were a few reasons why:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>I felt self-conscious.</b> Most people look sweaty and disheveled when they run. As an
          inexperienced runner, I thought I would look silly and slow.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Running felt uncomfortable.</b> It was difficult to manage my pace and my breathing.
          Sometimes, I would go too fast; sometimes, I would start to hyperventilate. I felt easily
          winded.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>I had decision fatigue.</b> There are a lot of decisions to make when you go on a run:
          what route to take, how far to run, how fast to run, what to listen to. This takes up
          mental capacity.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Here's what helped me address each running concern.
      </p>
      <p><b>I felt self-conscious.</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Adjust your mindset.</b> Most people don't care how you look and won't comment on it.
          If you do get rude comments from someone, you can tell him to go away and mind his own business.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Get proper workout clothes.</b> Workout clothes should feel good and enable movement.
          Running in leggings is way better than running in jeans, and cute leggings make working
          out more fun.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Running felt uncomfortable.</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Start with walking and a daily step goal.</b> The most common goal I see is 10,000 steps
          (~4 miles). However, that did not feel achievable. You can start
          with a fraction of that. Even 1,000 steps is better than nothing. In 2020, I started with a daily step goal of 5,000 steps (~2 miles)
          a day. That let me build up a habit of walking and find my favorite walking loop. Then, I
          gradually increased the goal to 7,000 steps. You can also adjust your goal based on your fitness and stage of life. After giving birth, I walked zero steps.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Run slowly.</b> I used to have an internal voice saying how fast I <i>should</i> be
          running: 10 minutes per mile. However, I found it very uncomfortable to move that quickly. At some point, I
          internalized that it is OK to run slowly. Even if you are the slowest runner, you are
          faster than everyone who isn't running. You can go at whatever pace works for you. If you find it
          hard to run continuously, you can try combination run/walk plans i.e. run for 30 seconds,
          walk for 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Gradually increase mileage and frequency.</b> I did not start out running very far or very often. I slowly added workouts and increased my running distance over time. When I trained for my first half marathon, in week one, I ran one mile once. In week two, I ran two miles once. Starting out
          slowly gave me enough time to get used to running.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>I had decision fatigue.</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Run a fixed route.</b> You can plot a new route at home or walk a route before you run
          it. In my neighborhood, I regularly walked a 1.2 mile loop, and I used that for training. I suggest finding a short loop you like. As you build endurance, you can run the loop multiple times or find a longer path.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Set a specific goal.</b> My first running goal was to run the SF half marathon and run the whole distance, regardless of pace. You could also just aim to complete a race by walking and/or running. If you walk a 5k, you are still faster than everyone who isn't moving. Note that running for weight loss is a more dubious goal. You may not lose weight even if you run and run and run.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Sign up (and pay) for a race.</b> When I pay money and commit to do something, I am more likely to
          follow through. You can also enlist your friends! Tell them to sign up for the same race, whatever distance. Encourage each other, and hold each other accountable.  
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Follow a training plan.</b> There are a few running apps (i.e. Strava) for tracking runs. I used the app Runkeeper. It has

            target="_blank"
            >customized training plans</a
          >. On Runkeeper, you can sign up for a 7-day trial before you commit and buy the app. For example, I followed training plans for the 2022 SF half and the 2023 Golden Gate half. The app told me when to
          run, how far to run, and how fast to run. As an aside, if you use Runkeeper, I recommend

            >checking your privacy settings</a
          >. Everything is public by default, which I think is creepy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Listen to a running playlist.</b> I used to listen to my Liked Songs while running, but I
          found it hard to run to slower songs. To address this, I created upbeat, fast Spotify playlists for pacing:
          <a
            href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/21tihcxLYa57ON6r8q2d4q?si=ab495a55bd3e4a22"
            target="_blank"
            >a 150-165 BPM playlist</a
          > and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3oCxH7V1VnAz2R32AhVPa6?si=2bb834ba57b44ffc" target="_blank">an even speedier 165-180 BPM playlist</a>. 
          These playlists helped me run at a consistent pace. The playlists are fast-paced with high BPM because taking smaller
          steps reduces stress on your legs. For more technical details, see

        tldr: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0" target="_blank">Just do it.</a> You don't need a "perfect" running plan, just one that works for you. Address your mental blockers, and go run (or walk).
