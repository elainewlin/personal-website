        There's a plague going on. To reduce the burden on the healthcare system, I (and many
        others) have been practicing social distancing. This post is a reflection on my everyday
        life routines for the past few weeks. Maybe you'll find something to do or something you
        like.
      </p>
      <p>The 3 sections are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Music and Computers: </strong>Activities I like and spend a lot of time on</li>
        <li><strong>General Self Care:</strong> Taking care of physical and mental health</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Work, LDR, Jams, and Exercise: </strong>Modifying routines to the current
          situation
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="text-large">Music and Computers</h2>
      <p>
        I like music and computers. If you're also interested in these topics, I'm happy to chat! If
        you're looking to learn a new skill (e.g. picking up an instrument, software skills), I
        generally like teaching and would be happy to answer questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Music:</strong> I sing and play instruments: ukulele, guitar, piano (<a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtscOI_XyD8WxEgWyYtAXaQ"
          rel="noopener nofollow"
          >Youtube</a
        >).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I've taught a handful of beginners with no musical experience to play a basic song on the
          ukulele in about 30 minutes. Learning an instrument is much easier when you know where to
          start.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Computers:</strong> By trade, I'm a full stack software engineer.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I've been working at
          <a href="https://digit.co/">Digit</a>, a financial health app, for the past few months,
          and it's been pretty great so far. If you're looking for a job, I'd be happy to submit a
          referral.
          <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/digit" rel="noopener nofollow">Open roles</a>
          are Product Designer, Product Analyst, Software Engineer, Growth Partnerships Lead.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you're getting started with software engineering, I can help answer questions regarding
          building a website, career advice, etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="text-large">General Self Care</h2>
      <p>
        Some of my life routines haven't changed. These include habits around self care, which I'll
        define as taking care of my physical and mental health. Maintaining these habits helps keep
        me happy and healthy.
      </p>
      <p>One guideline I live by is to put physical health first. This unsurprisingly involves:</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Getting plenty of good sleep.</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you want to get better at this, I'd recommend reading the
          <a
            href="https://www.sleepassociation.org/about-sleep/sleep-hygiene-tips/"
            rel="noopener nofollow"
            >ASA tips on sleep hygiene</a
          >. You can implement the tips that are most relevant to you e.g. reducing caffeine
          consumption or developing a better nighttime routine.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Drinking plenty of water.</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I got a new
          <a
            href="https://smile.amazon.com/Green-Sequoia-Cactaki-Infuser-Non-Toxic/dp/B06XCMJ6LM"
            rel="noopener nofollow"
            >water bottle</a
          >
          that tracks water consumption, so this has been a lot more fun lately.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Eating plants.</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Since I'm vegan, this is, by definition, all I eat.</li>
        <li>
          More concretely, I really like pre-washed bags of spinach and frozen vegetables, such as
          peas.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Moving about.</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I aim to go outside for at least 30 minutes a day. Right now, this also involves
          maintaining at least 6 feet from others.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I think putting physical health first is incredibly simple, but important. Many negative
        emotions have a physical root — I feel more sad and anxious when sleepy and more irritable
        when hungry. Taking care of my physical health helps put me in a far better position to
        handle everything else in my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another self-care routine I do is regular check-ins. In the morning, I do a daily check-in
        to reflect on 3 questions:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Sleep Hygiene:</strong> When am I sleeping? How is my sleep hygiene?</li>
        <li><strong>General Mood:</strong> How do I feel and why?</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Gratitude: </strong>What am I happy about or thankful for? What have I
          accomplished?
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>On a weekly basis, I'll do a check-in to reflect generally on:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>What am I happy about this week?</li>
        <li>What am I unhappy about this week and why?</li>
        <li>How can I adjust my behavior moving forwards?</li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="text-large">Work, LDR, Jams, and Exercise</h2>
      <p>
        There are 4 main areas of my life that have changed due to shelter in place: work, LDR,
        jams, and exercise. Over time, I've gotten better at modifying routines to the current
        situation.
      </p>
      <b> Work </b>
      <p>
        I'm grateful that as a software engineer, I can work from home. The biggest tip that's
        helped me is to move my work laptop off my desk and onto my shelf when I'm not working. This
        helps maintain a physical separation between when I'm working and not working and helps
        create a dedicated environment for focus.
      </p>
      <b> LDR </b>
      <p>
        Because there are no in-person visits, my relationship has temporarily converted to a LDR
        (long distance relationship). Here's some assorted activities and games that we've enjoyed:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Play games together over the Internet.</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://gartic.io/">https://gartic.io/</a>
          — Pictionary
        </li>

          <a href="https://boardgamearena.com/" rel="noopener nofollow"
            >https://boardgamearena.com/</a
          >
          — Assorted board games e.g. Sushi Go.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Play games together over </strong
        ><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>Steam</strong></a
        ><strong>.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        How this works is you download the Steam app on your computer, and it lets you play games on
        your computer. Many games can just be played with the keyboard. However, if you'd prefer to
        have a controller, you can get one that plugs into your laptop — I have

          >this Logitech gamepad</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        I generally like cute/lighthearted games. Here's what I currently own and if you can play
        them with 2 people. Some games support Steam remote play-together, when 2 people play
        together by sharing 1 person's keyboard.

          >, which has prompts for essential conversations.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <b> Jams </b>
      <p>
        Music groups (a cappella, ukulele) that I'd normally meet in person have been meeting
        remotely via video call. Unfortunately, there's no realistic way to make music and jam
        together remotely due to network lag — it takes time for the audio/video signal on your
        computer to make it to somebody else's computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        For my a cappella group, instead of jamming together, we just call to hang out, chat, or
        play games.
      </p>
      <p>For my ukulele group, we make do with a virtual jam:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Everybody uses headphones to avoid echo. Muting the microphone when not talking also helps
          reduce echo.
        </li>
        <li>
          To play a song, one person, the leader, has their microphone on to lead the song.
          Everybody else mutes their mic. This means that everybody who isn't leading can play along
          to the leader.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="text-large">Exercise</h2>
      <p>
        Moving about is important for general physical health. Since gyms are closed, I get exercise
        by going on walks or bike rides (while maintaining distance from others). I aim to go
        outside for at least 30 minutes a day.
      </p>
      <p>
        On busy days, this consists of a short walk around my neighborhood. When I have more time, I
        like to go on a bike ride. I have a folding bike, which fits in my room. The Lyft bike share
        program is cheap ($2 for 30 minutes) if you just want to try out biking.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-large">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Thanks for reading this far. I hope this has been helpful, and I wish you all the best.</p>
