      <p>I like e-books and audiobooks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          For e-books, invest in a Kindle (or other e-reader) to read without distractions or eye
          strain. Other devices have internet access, other apps, and glaring back lights. The
          benefits of reading more books outweigh the upfront cost.
        </li>
        <li>For audiobooks, listen on 2x speed or more if you're impatient.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You can search for other free e-book sites, but most are sketchy with limited collections.
      </p>
      <p>It's worth spending money on books:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Most books cost <$15, about as much as a restaurant meal or a movie ticket.</li>
        <li>Try free e-book samples before buying. Don't buy or read books you don't like.</li>
        <li>
          I have an <a href="https://www.audible.com/" target="_blank">Audible</a> membership for
          audiobooks and buy e-books adhoc.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="text-large" id="make-time">Make time to read</h2>
      <p>Keep reading material nearby. When you leave the house, bring a book with you.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>For physical books, bring a large-enough bag.</li>
        <li>For digital books, make sure devices are charged.</li>
        <li>For audiobooks, bring headphones.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Read in spare moments. If you have an hour of commute time, then you have an hour of reading
        time. <sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="inline-footnote-2">(2)</a></sup>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Listen to an audiobook while driving or walking.</li>
        <li>Read on trains and buses.</li>
        <li>Bring a book to an appointment, and read in the waiting room or in line.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Read in dedicated chunks of time. If you have time to browse social media, play video games,
        or watch TV, then you have time to read. Reading feels more rewarding and relaxing, but has
        a higher start-up cost.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Read for just 5 minutes. After that initial focus time, it's easier to continue reading.
        </li>
        <li>Keep a book nearby, and move your phone and laptop to another room.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="text-large">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Why do you want to read? Some reasons are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I read fiction as an escape.</li>
        <li>I want to learn more about x.</li>
        <li>I want concentrated knowlege not found in status updates or articles.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Love of learning motivated me to pick up reading again. I loved reading when I was a kid.
        However, I didn't read for many years throughout high school and college. To get started, I
        realized money spent on books is money well spent. I stopped being cheap and invested in an
        e-reader and e-books. Having reading material nearby made it easier to read more books.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time, I found more ways to read. I learned that libraries have digital books, and I got
        into audiobooks. This piece captures how I read more books. I hope you try different
        suggestions to see what works for you.

      <p>Here's what the Library extension looks like:</p>

      <h2 class="text-large">Footnotes</h2>
      <p id="footnote-1">
        <a href="#inline-footnote-1">(1)</a> I didn't like the first few audiobooks I tried. Sample
        a few genres to see what you like. My favorite genre is nonfiction memoirs read by the
        author.
      </p>
      <p id="footnote-2">
        <a href="#inline-footnote-2">(2)</a> Stay vigilant when reading in public. I avoid listening
        to anything when walking through sketchy neighborhoods. Keep an eyeball on your surroundings
        on public transit.
