      My partner, C, and I started planning our wedding Oct 8, 2022 and got married Sep 9, 2023. We had a 40-person outdoor wedding in Springfield, Ohio. Planning a wedding is a lot of work, and this piece describes how we planned ours.

    <h3 id="initial-planning">Initial planning</h3>
    <p><b>Do you want a wedding at all?</b> We wanted a wedding because it's an excuse to get all of our family and
      friends together. We wanted a special event (and party!) to mark the occasion.</p>
    <p><b>Create some basic guidelines for what you want.</b> For example, here's what our initial wedding doc looked
      like in October 2022. For locations, we considered getting married in Ohio, where my parents live, or around San Francisco, where
      we live.</p>
    <pre>
  Guest target: 50-100
  Time: 2023 (June - September)
  
  Locations
  - Ohio
  - South Bay
  - Napa
  
  Budget: $10K total
  Officiator: Grandpa or Pops
  
  Photographer: TODO
  
  Day-of wedding planner: TODO
  
  Day-of DJ: TODO
  
  Music
  - Dancing!
  
  Menu
  - Vegan!
    </pre>
    <h3 id="venue">Book a venue</h3>
    <p><b>Decide on a location, time frame, and venue.</b> We made a spreadsheet to track venue details like:
    <ol>
      <li>Name of the venue</li>
      <li>Link to the venue website</li>
      <li>Total capacity of the venue</li>
      <li>Distance from home. We looked for venues within an hour's drive.</li>
      <li>Whether we contacted them</li>
      <li>Additional notes</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>We then filtered the list based on a few factors:
    <ol>
      <li><b>Cost:</b> C looked into a San Francisco wedding. The
        cheaper venues cost at least $5k for a Saturday. Other costs were also higher, and it looked like the total
        would be much more than $10k. Due to cost factors, we decided to get married in Ohio.</li>
      <li><b>Aesthetics/preferences:</b> We wanted rustic elegance for the overall aesthetic. We looked at both indoor/outdoor locations. Of the initial list, we crossed a few off because:
        <ul>
          <li>C did not want to get married in a barn.</li>
          <li>One venue was a meat farm, and we didn't want to support that.</li>
          <li>One arboreteum looked nice, but was not closed to the public.</li>
        </ul>
      <li><b>Availability:</b> We looked for a 9/9/23 or 9/16/23 wedding date, and some venues weren't available.
      </li>
      <li><b>Communication/responsiveness:</b> Some venues did not respond promptly to our messages. We took this as a bad sign and
        crossed them off the list.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>Once you have a short list of venues, you can look into details and narrow things down further. We created a list of venue questions based on some reference articles (see <a href="https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-venue-site-tour-questions-to-ask" target="_blank">link</a> and <a href="https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-ideas/questions-to-ask-your-wedding-venue" target="_blank">link</a>) and created a list:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Is the space accessible?</li>
      <li>What space is there for the ceremony, reception, and dancing?</li>
      <li>Is there parking?</li>
      <li>What are the vendor options?</li>
      <li>Are there noise restraints?</li>
      <li>Can they handle tailored requests?</li>
      <li>What’s the rental fee? What’s included in the cost? Are there any other fees?</li>
      <li>How many hours do we have the venue?</li>
      <li>Are there changing areas?</li>
      <li>What services are included?</li>
      <li>Does the venue provide setup / breakdown?</li>
      <li>How many weddings do they have in a day?</li>
      <li>What equipment is provided i.e. tables, chairs, decorations?</li>
      <li>Can we bring our own alcohol?</li>
      <li>Where are the restrooms?</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>If possible, visit the venues in person. In October 2022, C flew out to Ohio, drove about, and visited 4 venues in a day. For each venue, he asked questions, took photos, and wrote down notes.
    <p>Asking questions and visiting give you more information for decision-making. Some places look nice, but don't have a nice surrounding area. Some places have additional fees or require you use their catering, which can increase costs. Some people are late when you visit, which we took as a bad sign.</p>
    <p>At the end of this process, we booked the <a href="https://www.partingtonspringhouse.com/about.html" target="_blank">Partington Spring House</a> for a 9/9/23 wedding. We picked it since it was the most beautiful location by far. As a con, we noted that it was all outdoors and would require more logistic work.</p>

    </p>
    <h3 id="vendors-guests">Figure out vendors and guests</h3>
    <p>
      We booked several vendors:
      <ul>
        <li>DJ to play music during dancing</li>
        <li>Photographer to take photos during the event</li>
        <li>Caterer to feed our guests dinner</li>
        <li>Vegan bakery for our wedding cake</li>
        <li>Day-of coordinator to handle things that come up</li>
        <li>Party rental for a tent and dance floor</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
   
    <p>
      charcoal gray and navy blue make it easy to find matching suits
      warm colors
      I like the colors wine red and rose gold, and they are flattering on me.

      helpful for coordinating family outfits, decorations
    </p>

    <p>
    <li>Figure out wedding priorities.
      - Make a guest list.
      - Find vendors.
      - DJ, photographer, caterer, cake, day-of-coordinator, party rental
      - florist
      - Create a wedding website.
    </p>

      <img src="/assets/wedding-color-palette.png"
        alt="4 colored squares. The colors are wine red, rose gold, charcoal gray, and navy blue." width="400" />
    </p>
    <p>
      - Decide a cake.
      - we did cake tasting.
      - some colors are harder to pull off i.e. yellow/brown/green cakes may be harder to get right.
      - Figure out the rehearsal dinner.
      - Figure out a post-wedding celebration.
    </p>

    <p>
      - Wedding outfits.
      - Personal aesthetics: makeup, hair, nails.
      - Rings.
      - Wedding decorations.
      - Wedding favors.
      - Figure out a seating chart. Do this after you have RSVPs.
      - Figure out the number and size of tables.
      - Wedding vows.
    </p>

    <p>
      - Figure out marriage license.
      - Make sure officiant is licensed for the relevant state.
      - Marriage license gives you permission to be married. After it's filled out, you get a marriage certificate
      certifying that you're married.

      - Create a schedule.
      - Delegate.

      Helpful tools:
      - Google Docs
      - Google Sheets
      - Todoist for task management
      - Canva for visual planning
      - We used it to plan decorations. You could also use it to figure out the overall ambiance, personal
      aesthetics,
      etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The biggest takeaways from the process are:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Expect lots of logistics and arbitrary decisions.</b> Planning a wedding is a lot like planning a team offsite. You get to figure out where to go, what to do, and what to eat. We made many decisions here quickly since they don't matter that much in the grand scheme of things.</li>
        <li><b>Expect something to go wrong.</b> We had lots of logistics, people, and things to track, so naturally, there were some snafus to sort out. For example, we had dance floor issues and called the party rental place for adjustments the day/morning before the wedding. Forgetting things is also normal - C forgot his suit vest, and I forgot bobby pins.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3 id="budget">Budget breakdown</h3>
    <p>
      We spent ~$15k for a 40-person outdoor wedding in Springfield, Ohio. We also had a lot of help. Instead of
      getting
      delivery, family helped pick up the cake, Friday dinner, and Sunday lunch. Our family also bought several
      things,
      so this number is not the full cost.
