    <h2>How to plan a wedding</h2>
    <p>
      I recently got married. We had a 40-person outdoor wedding in Springfield, Ohio. My partner, C, and I started planning on Oct 8, 2022 and got married Sep 9, 2023. Here's how we planned it:
    </p>
    <p><b>Do you want a wedding at all?</b> We wanted a wedding because it's an excuse to get all of our family and friends together. We wanted a special event to mark the occasion.</p>
    <p><b>Create some basic guidelines for what you want.</b> For example, here's what our initial wedding doc looked like in October 2022.</p>
    <pre>
  Guest target: 50-100
  Time: 2023 (June - September)
  
  Locations
  - Ohio
  - South Bay
  - Napa
  
  Budget: $10K total
  Officiator: Grandpa or Pops
  
  Photographer: TODO
  
  Day-of wedding planner: TODO
  
  Day-of DJ: TODO
  
  Music

      <img src="/assets/wedding-color-palette.png" alt="4 colored squares. The colors are wine red, rose gold, charcoal gray, and navy blue." width="400"/>
    </p>
    <p>
      charcoal gray and navy blue make it easy to find matching suits
      warm colors
      I like the colors wine red and rose gold, and they are flattering on me.

      helpful for coordinating family outfits, decorations
    </p>
    <p>
    - Figure out wedding priorities.
      - Budget.
      - What do you want from a wedding?
        - rustic elegance
        - lots of logistics, arbitrary decisions
    - Decide on a time frame.
    - Decide on a location.
    - Find a venue.
    - Make a guest list.
      - 60 to 85 percent 
      - fewer people will show up than you expect
      - 41 people showed up; invited 85
    - Find vendors.
      - DJ, photographer, caterer, cake, day-of-coordinator, party rental
      - florist
    - Create a wedding website.
    </p>

    <p>
    - Decide a cake.
      - we did cake tasting.
      - some colors are harder to pull off i.e. yellow/brown/green cakes may be harder to get right.
    - Figure out the rehearsal dinner.
    - Figure out a post-wedding celebration.
    </p>

    <p>
    - Wedding outfits.
    - Personal aesthetics: makeup, hair, nails.
    - Rings.
    - Wedding decorations.
    - Wedding favors.
    - Figure out a seating chart. Do this after you have RSVPs.
      - Figure out the number and size of tables.
    - Wedding vows.
    </p>

    <p>
    - Figure out marriage license.
      - Make sure officiant is licensed for the relevant state.
      - Marriage license gives you permission to be married. After it's filled out, you get a marriage certificate certifying that you're married.
      
    - Create a schedule.
      - Delegate.
      - something is going to go wrong.
    </p>

    Helpful tools:

    <h3>Budget breakdown</h3>
    <p>
      We spent ~$15k for a 40-person outdoor wedding in Springfield, Ohio. We also had a lot of help. Instead of getting delivery, family helped pick up the cake, Friday dinner, and Sunday lunch. Our family also bought several things, so this number is not the full cost.
