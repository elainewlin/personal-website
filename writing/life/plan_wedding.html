        C and I started planning our wedding Oct 8, 2022 and got married Sep 9, 2023. We had a
        40-person outdoor wedding in Ohio. Planning a wedding is a lot of work! This
        piece describes how we planned ours, and I hope you'll find it helpful. I broke down the
        process into:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><a href="#initial-planning">Initial planning</a></li>
        <li><a href="#venue">Book a venue</a></li>

        <li><a href="#appendix">Appendix</a></li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The biggest takeaways from the process are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Expect lots of logistics and arbitrary decisions.</b> Planning a wedding is a lot like
          planning a team offsite. You get to figure out where to go, what to do, and what to eat.
          We cared most about getting our family together to celebrate and decided on the little
          details quickly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Expect something to go wrong.</b> There are lots of logistics, people, and things to
          track, so snafus are bound to happen. For example, we had dance floor issues and called
          the party rental place for adjustments the day/morning before the wedding. Forgetting
          things is also normal - C forgot his suit vest, and I forgot bobby pins.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="initial-planning">Initial planning</h3>
      <p>
        <b>To start, do you want a wedding at all?</b> We wanted a wedding to commemorate the
        marriage and celebrate with our family and friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Create some basic guidelines for what you want.</b> Sketching out this outline helped us
        figure out wedding priorities and make decisions. For example, here's what our initial
        wedding doc looked like in October 2022. 
      </p>

      <h3 id="venue">Book a venue</h3>
      <p>
        The first time we booked was the venue. This helps constrain and guide all of the other
        decisions. We explicitly searched for wedding venues, but note that there are other location
        options. For example, you could get married in a backyard, at a park, or in a general party
        space.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Decide on a location, time frame, and venue.</b> Start with high-level details. We made a
        spreadsheet to track venue details like:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Name of the venue</li>
        <li>Link to the venue website</li>
        <li>Total capacity of the venue</li>
        <li>Distance from home. We looked for venues within an hour's drive.</li>
        <li>Whether we contacted them</li>
        <li>Additional notes</li>
      </ol>
      <p>We then filtered the list based on a few factors:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Cost:</b> C looked into a San Francisco wedding. The cheaper venues cost at least $5k
          for a Saturday. Other costs were also higher, and it looked like the total would be much
          more than $10k. Due to cost factors, we decided to get married in Ohio.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Aesthetics/preferences:</b> We wanted rustic elegance for the overall aesthetic. We
          looked at both indoor/outdoor locations. Of the initial list, we crossed a few off
          because:
          <ul>
            <li>C did not want to get married in a barn.</li>
            <li>One venue was a meat farm, and that didn't fit with the vegan theme.</li>
            <li>
              One arboretum looked nice, but was not closed to the public. We wanted our wedding to
              be more private.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Availability:</b> We looked for a 9/9/23 or 9/16/23 wedding date, and some venues
          weren't available.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Communication/responsiveness:</b> Some venues did not respond promptly to our messages.
          We took this as a bad sign and crossed them off the list.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <b>Filter the short list of venues.</b> Once you have a short list of venues, you can look
        into details and narrow things down further. We created a list of venue questions based on
        some reference articles (see
        <a
          href="https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-venue-site-tour-questions-to-ask"
          target="_blank"
          >link</a
        >
        and
        <a
          href="https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-ideas/questions-to-ask-your-wedding-venue"
          target="_blank"
          >link</a
        >) and created a list:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Is the space accessible?</li>
        <li>What space is there for the ceremony, reception, and dancing?</li>
        <li>Is there parking?</li>
        <li>What are the vendor options?</li>
        <li>Are there noise restraints?</li>
        <li>Can they handle tailored requests?</li>
        <li>What's the rental fee? What's included in the cost? Are there any other fees?</li>
        <li>How many hours do we have the venue?</li>
        <li>Are there changing areas?</li>
        <li>What services are included?</li>
        <li>Does the venue provide setup / breakdown?</li>
        <li>How many weddings do they have in a day?</li>
        <li>What equipment is provided i.e. tables, chairs, decorations?</li>
        <li>Can we bring our own alcohol?</li>
        <li>Where are the restrooms?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If possible, visit the venues in person. In October 2022, C flew out to Ohio, drove about,
        and visited 4 venues in a day. For each venue, he asked questions, took photos, and wrote
        down notes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Asking questions and visiting give you more information for decision-making. Some places
        look nice, but don't have a nice surrounding area. Some places have additional fees or
        require you use their catering, which can increase costs. Some people are late when you
        visit, which we took as a bad sign.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end of this process, we booked the
        <a href="https://www.partingtonspringhouse.com/about.html" target="_blank"
          >Partington Spring House</a
        >
        for a 9/9/23 wedding. We picked it since it was the most beautiful location by far. As a
        con, we noted that it was all outdoors and would require more logistic work.
      </p>

        />
        <span class="center">Green is soothing on the eye.</span>
      </p>
      <h3 id="vendors-guests">Figure out vendors and guests</h3>
      <p>
        Next, we figured out other vendors and guests. That way, we could make sure vendors were
        available on the wedding day. For guests, attending a wedding is a time investment, so we
        wanted to give as much advance notice as we could.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Book other vendors.</b> The vendor list will vary. For example, instead of a florist, we
        bought artificial flowers to cut down on cost and waste. Your venue may also provide some
        additional support, such as a day-of coordinator. If you'd like more logistic help, you may
        want a wedding planner. We booked several vendors:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          DJ for sound support during the ceremony and music for dancing. During the ceremony, our
          officiant had a clip-on mic so he could be easily heard.
        </li>
        <li>
          Photographer to take photos during the event. That way, we could look back on photos to
          remember the day.
        </li>
        <li>Caterer to feed our guests reception snacks and dinner.</li>
        <li>Vegan bakery for our wedding cake.</li>
        <li>
          Day-of coordinator to decorate and handle things that come up. For example, she set up the
          arch flowers and table decor.
        </li>
        <li>
          Party rental place for a tent and dance floor. We had an outdoor wedding, so the tent
          provided shade from the sun, and the dance floor provided a harder surface for dancing.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For food, you may want to do a tasting. We didn't do a tasting for the caterer. We did
        sample some cupcake flavors, and that was a delight.
      </p>
      <p class="center">
        <img
          src="/assets/wedding/happy-chicks-cupcakes.jpg"

        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Make a guest list.</b> We made a guest list of our family and friends. Note that not all
        invited guests will show up. Per a basic Google search: "75-85 percent of wedding guests
        usually attend. The breakdown: 85 percent of local guests, 55 percent of out-of-town guests,
        and 35 percent of destination wedding guests will show up." This was surprising to us, but
        lines up well with our experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Create a wedding website.</b> This is helpful for logistics. We used
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.zola.com/">Zola</a>. As the date approaches, guests
        will have questions on schedule, travel, registry, dress code, etc. A website makes it easy
        to answer questions. We also used the wedding website to manage the guest list details, such
        as save-the-dates, invites, and RSVPs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Send out save-the-dates/invites. </b> You can do this digitally or via mail. You can also
        repurpose save-the-dates as official invitations. We sent out separate save-the-dates and
        invites via mail, and we picked
        <a
          href="https://www.zola.com/wedding-planning/invitations/a1a8cc12-a716-495e-8868-92f96bbeafa7"
          target="_blank"
          >the Maywood design on Zola</a
        >
        since it is simple and easy-to-read.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are sending things via mail, I'd recommend ordering a proof, a sample card, to your
        address first. The card can look different on your computer than in person. This is a good
        way of validating that everything looks right before you order a big batch.
      </p>
      <h3 id="aesthetics">Decide aesthetic details</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Start by picking a color scheme.</b> This is an easy way to make things look cohesive. A
        color scheme helps you figure out decorations and coordinate family photos. For our colors,
        we picked wine red, rose gold, charcoal gray, and navy blue. Here's how we picked the
        colors:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We prefer warm colors (i.e. reds and pinks) to cool ones (i.e. blues and greens).</li>
        <li>Wine red and rose gold are flattering on me, so I like those colors.</li>
        <li>
          Charcoal gray and navy blue are common neutrals, so it makes it easy for folks to find
          suits.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="center">
        <img
          src="/assets/wedding/wedding-color-palette.png"
          alt="4 colored squares. The colors are wine red, rose gold, charcoal gray, and navy blue."
          width="400"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Figure out your wedding outfits.</b> C bought a suit and tie matching the color scheme. I
        did the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Dress:</b> Wedding dresses come in lots of styles and silhouettes. I picked a
          short-sleeve, ankle-length dress so it'd be easier to dance and move about.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Accessories:</b> I had a pearl necklace and pearl earrings, and I bought a pearl
          headband to match. I had some blush block heel sandals which match my skin tone and the
          color scheme.
        </li>
        <li><b>Hair:</b> I have a pixie cut. I got a hair cut a week before so it'd look sharp.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Makeup:</b> I did my own makeup. I tried going to a salon, but didn't like the look.
          You can try booking a trial appointment to see if you like it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Nails:</b> I got an impromptu gel manicure the day-of the wedding. In retrospect, I'd
          suggest testing this out beforehand to make sure you like the look and feel of things. The
          photos don't have too many paw close-ups, so this was perhaps inessential.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Buy rings. </b>You can use a ring sizer to measure your paws and make sure things fit.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Decide on a cake aesthetic.</b> Based on the color scheme, we decided what our cake would
        look like. Note that some colors are harder to pull off in cake form. For example,
        yellow/brown/green cakes can be harder to get right and may look dubious. We wanted a simple
        and elegant cake, so we provided the bakery with the following reference photo. They did a
        great job, and the actual cake turned out beautiful. We also got a lil 4-inch gluten free
        cake on the side.

          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>
        <b>Figure out wedding decorations, flowers, and favors.</b> Wedding decorations and flowers
        help make the day feel special. For flowers, we got artificial ones from
        <a href="https://www.lingsmoment.com/pages/wedding-color-collections" target="_blank"
          >Ling's Moment</a
        >
        to reduce cost and waste. They have coordinated color schemes and many types of flowers, so
        it was easy to pick decorations. The smaller flowers are in dusty rose & mauve; my bouquet
        and the arch are in burgundy & dusty rose. For wedding favors, we bought some 3-inch gift
        boxes and put a lil surprise in for our guests.
      </p>
      <p>Here's how we set things up:</p>
      <p>For the guest table, we put gift boxes, a small bouquet, a table number, and a candle.</p>

      <h3 id="ceremony">Decide ceremony details</h3>
      <p>There are several details for the wedding ceremony itself:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Figure out the marriage license/certificate. </b> The exact steps depend on where
          you're getting married. A marriage license gives you permission to be married. After it's
          filled out, you get a marriage certificate certifying that you're married.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Pick an officiant.</b> C's grandfather officiated our wedding. We deferred to him on
          the ceremony style. Note that your officiant may need to fill out paperwork depending on
          where you're getting married.
        </li>
        <li><b>Write vows.</b> We went with the basic wedding vows with some small tweaks.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Figure out a procession.</b> Who is walking? What is the walking order? We did not have
          bridesmaids or groomsmen. Our procession was simple: Gramps (the officiant), C, C's
          parents, our baby nephew ringbearer + his parents, my parents, E. Personally, I'm not fond
          of the idea of a bride's father "giving her away", and the aisle was too narrow for both
          of my parents, so I scampered down by myself.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Pick procession music.</b> You can have different music for different points in the
          procession. We had one song,
          <a

      <h3 id="pre-post-gatherings">Plan pre/post wedding gatherings</h3>
      <p>
        Many folks travel long distances to attend a wedding. Pre/post wedding gatherings are a good
        way to spend more time with folks if they're around.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pre-wedding gathering is often a rehearsal dinner. Depending on your wedding, you may
        find it helpful to do a dry-run of logistics. In our case, on Friday before the wedding, we
        had an informal family gathering at my parents' house and ordered catering.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the post-wedding gathering on Sunday, we booked a spot in a nearby park, invited
        everybody who was around, and ordered Indian food. Note that after the wedding, folks may
        fly out, so it's good to do this earlier in the day.
      </p>

        <b>Draft a seating chart after you have RSVPs. </b> A seating chart is helpful so guests
        know where to go. If you're attending a wedding, there are lots of unknown faces, so it's
        helpful for the couple to provide some structure here.
      </p>
      <p>
        To start, figure out the number and size of tables at the venue. This constrains how you
        will group people together. For instance, your venue could have long rectangular tables or
        small circular ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that your seating chart may change if things come up, or some folks can't make it. We
        also ended up making last-minute changes to the seating chart after visiting the venue and
        seeing the table setup.

        <b>Make a schedule of events for the wedding weekend. </b> We got married Saturday, 9/9, and
        we wrote down the schedule for the weekend. The schedule also included vendor details and

        We had a lot of help, and we're so thankful for everybody who was involved. Some takeaways
        here are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Delegate tasks, and accept help when possible.</b> Our families helped out a lot, and
          we couldn't have done it without them. For instance, we delegated picking up a
          cake/food/drinks and had a lot of help with assembling wedding favors, setting up, and
          decorating.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Check out the wedding venue sooner and with more folks.</b> We had an outdoor wedding,
          and some parts of the setup were more DIY. We flew in to Ohio on Thursday night, so we
          visited the wedding venue on Friday. There was a good amount to do on Friday: rearranging
          tables, validating the setup, and checking the ceremony area. In retrospect, it would have
          been nice to do this a day or two earlier and bring family along so they could help out.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Celebrate!</b> A wedding is such a special time, and it was so lovely to celebrate with
        all of our family and friends.
      </p>

      <b><p>Helpful tools</p></b>
      <p>
        C and I are like a startup. We have many docs, robust task management, and regular
        check-ins. For the wedding, we found it helpful to use:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://docs.google.com" target="_blank">Google Docs</a> for writing schedules
          and general planning
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://sheets.google.com" target="_blank">Google Sheets</a> for comparing venues
          and tracking budget
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://todoist.com" target="_blank">Todoist</a> for task assignment/management
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://canva.com" target="_blank">Canva</a> for visual planning</li>
      </ul>
      <b><p>Budget for the curious</p></b>
      <p>
        When other folks get married, I'm always curious how much it costs. In total, we spent ~$15k
        for a 40-person outdoor wedding in Ohio. This includes Saturday wedding
        vendors, decorations, our wedding outfits/bands, and the Friday/Sunday gatherings.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also had a lot of help, so this is not the full cost. Instead of getting delivery, we had
        folks help pick up the cake, Friday dinner, and Sunday lunch. Family also bought things,
        like drinks and decorations.
