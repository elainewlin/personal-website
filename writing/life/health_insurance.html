      <h2>Understanding Health Insurance</h2>
      <p>
        The USA health insurance system is confusing. This is a practical guide to understanding
        health insurance from the perspective of a young professional. I explain common healthcare
        definitions and pricing, acronyms and plans. I also include the process and script I use to
        make healthcare appointments.
      </p>
      <h3>Definitions</h3>
      <p>
        This is a short list of common terms I see when looking at my insurance. This is useful for
        calculating how much you're expected to pay for healthcare services. Even with insurance,
        healthcare can be expensive.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Premium:</b> How much does your health insurance cost? This is the amount paid for
          healthcare coverage, not any healthcare services. If you're covered through an employer,
          they'll often pay this amount.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Deductible:</b> The amount of money you have to pay out of pocket before insurance
          starts covering your expenses. For example, if you have a procedure for $200 and your
          deductible is $50, then you have to pay $50, and insurance can help cover the other $150.
          If you have a procedure for $40 and your deductible is $50, then you have to pay $40.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Co-insurance:</b> The percentage of the service cost you pay out of pocket. For
          example, suppose you have a procedure for $200, your deductible is $50, and your
          co-insurance is 20%. You have to pay the $50 deductible + 20% of the other $150 ($30), so
          you'd pay $80.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Co-pay:</b> The amount of money you have to pay out of pocket for doctor visits. For
          example, my vision plan has a $10 co-pay for eye exams, so I paid $10 for an eye exam.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Maximum coverage:</b> The maximum amount your insurance will pay for you in a year.
          After that, you have to pay out of pocket.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Out of Pocket Maximum:</b> The maximum amount of money you have to spend on medical
          care before your insurance covers 100% of your expenses.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Allowed Amount:</b> This is a negotiated rate between the health plan and the plan's
          in-network providers. The in-network providers agree to not charge more than the allowed
          amount to members of the health plan. Out-of-network providers can charge what they want.
          This is part of the reason why in-network providers are cheaper.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Acronyms</h3>
      <p>
        There are many types of health insurance plans. You may see the acronyms HMO, PPO, EPO, and
        POS. I'd suggest
        <a
          href="https://www.aetna.com/health-guide/hmo-pos-ppo-hdhp-whats-the-difference.html"
          target="_blank"
          >this article to explain the difference</a
        >. More practically, how do you pick an insurance plan?
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're in good health and paying for health insurance out of pocket, you can optimize for
        a cheaper plan (lower premium). When picking health insurance plans from an employer, you
        can ask the HR team or other employees in a similar stage of life to you. If you're don't
        need a lot of medical services, one rule of thumb is to favor the plan with the highest
        premium to the employer at no additional cost to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        An employer may also offer you an
        <b>FSA (a Flexible Spending Account)</b>. You can put money in this account to pay for
        assorted healthcare expenses. This includes doctor visits and assorted healthcare objects,
        such as bandages, sunscreen, allergy medicine, glasses, and painkillers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The advantage is that you don't pay taxes on this money. That means if you put $1000 in the
        account and would've paid 20% in income taxes, then you'd save 20% * $1000 = $200. However,
        you can't get the money back. If you don't use all the funds in a year, some funds can roll
        over to the next year, and some plans include a grace period (extra time to use the funds).
        If you still have unused FSA funds, they go to your employer.
      </p>
      <h3>Making an Appointment</h3>
      <p>
        This is the process and scripts I use for making healthcare appointments.
      </p>
      <b>Find relevant documents</b>
      <p>
        First, find out what insurance plans you have. I have separate plans for healthcare, vision,
        and dental, so I need to provide different insurance information depending on what
        healthcare service I need. I find this information through Zenefits, a type of HR software.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of documents, find your insurance card, a valid ID, and a payment method. The
        insurance card has a bunch of numbers that you'll need to tell the doctor. I got physical
        copies of my insurance cards in the mail, but virtual versions are also available on the
        healthcare plan's website. You'll need the ID and payment method later when you go to the
        doctor.
      </p>
      <b>Who do I contact?</b>
      <p>
        I start by searching for in-network providers near me via the healthcare plan website.
        In-network providers are cheaper, so that's why I search on the plan website first.
        Healthcare plan websites are usually clunky, but eventually give you a list of doctors,
        office locations, and phone numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        To filter the list, I sort by location to find doctors that are close to home or work. I
        also cross-reference review sites (e.g. Yelp, Google reviews) to see if a place has awful
        reviews. If it has 2-3 stars, I won't bother contacting them. A lot of doctors don't have
        reviews, so a lack of reviews doesn't deter me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes the search also gives you emails or doctor websites. Most doctors don't accept
        online appointments, so you need to call during business hours. Business hours vary, but you
        can aim for Monday - Friday 9 AM to 5 PM. You can also email, but they'll probably tell you
        to make a phone call.
      </p>
      <b>Phone Call Script</b>
      <p>
        This is the script I use when calling doctors. I like to write this down for reference
        before making a call. Make sure you have your insurance card available. Tweak anything in
        brackets according to your needs. For instance, a [procedure] can refer to any health care
        procedure such as a check-up, eye exam, or dental cleaning.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Call a doctor during business hours.</li>
        <li>
          Tell them `Hi. This is [your name]. I'm looking to get a [procedure] in the next 2 weeks.
          I have health insurance under my employer: [employer name], [name of health plan]. [Are
          you accepting new patients?] Do you have appointment availability soon?`
        </li>
        <li>
          If you don't know what procedure you need, you can ask for an appointment and briefly
          describe your problem e.g. `My [body part] hurts.`
        </li>
        <li>
          If they aren't available, and you're leaving voice mail, add `You can call me back at
          [your number].`
        </li>
        <li>
          If they have trouble spelling your name, spell it out for them using a phonetic alphabet.
          You don't have to memorize the official phonetic alphabet, and you can just make up words.
          For example, I often say `My last name is L as in lion, I as in ice cream, and N as in
          Nancy.`
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        I hope this helped explain how to navigate the messed up USA health insurance system so you
        can find affordable healthcare.
