      <p>
        This piece is on my peaceful productivity processes. Over time, I found tools, habits, and
        routines that help me feel less stressed and get work done. I don't have macho, superhuman
        advice, and this isn't about squeezing more work into your day. Sleep and rest are
        important.
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn't introduce new processes all at once. The long list below is the result of a lot of
        experimentation. My process is:
      </p>

      <p></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Stumble across an idea while reading books or articles.</li>
        <li>Try it out.</li>
        <li>Reflect on the results.</li>
        <li>Adapt the idea for my life.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>You can run your own experiments to see what works for you.</p>
      <p>The following sections are on:</p>

        <li><a href="#blocking-distractions">blocking distractions</a></li>
        <li><a href="#doing-tasks">doing tasks</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        More important topics come first. You don't need to be uber productive to be happy and
        healthy.

        Sometimes, I forget that my brain has a squishy human host. This section is on taking care
        of my body. Take care of your physical health first, and mental health often follows.

        Sleep is the most important. Here's how I practice good

        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Reserve bed for sleeping.</b>
          <ul>
            <li>I don't read, watch TV, or use my phone in bed. Move devices to another room.</li>
            <li>
              I get out of bed if I can't sleep. I either migrate to the couch or sit on the floor
              doing nothing in the dark.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>No devices at night.</b> I set my devices to automatically block the Internet at night.
          For more information on how to do this, see the section on
          <a href="#blocking-distractions">blocking distractions</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Go to sleep and wake up around the same time every day.</b> This helps my body know
          when to feel sleepy or awake. I sleep 10 PM - 6:30 AM. Your hours will vary.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Get 8-9 hours of sleep every night.</b> I feel best when I get that much sleep.
          Sleeping 7 hours and working an extra hour doesn't work for me.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Prioritize bedtime over social commitments.</b> After many years, I learned that I
          should make this trade-off. It doesn't make sense for me to stay up late. At night, I feel
          sad, anxious, and lonely. I also can't sleep in after the sun rises.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>No coffee after 12 PM.</b> Caffeine has
          <a

            >a long half-life</a
          >
          so it remains in your system for quite a while. I have a cup of coffee at 7 AM. For the
          rest of the day, I sip tea, not coffee.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Try a sleep podcast</b>. When my mind is racing at night, listening to a sleep podcast
          helps me fall asleep. I recommend
          <a href="https://www.nothingmuchhappens.com/" target="_blank">Nothing Much Happens</a>
          or

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here are some other ways I take care of my body:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Drink water throughout the day</b>. Drinking 8 cups of water a day is
          <a
            href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/water/art-20044256"

            >a water bottle with time markers</a
          >
          and aim to drink 6 cups of water a day.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Get dressed for success</b>. I like putting on work-appropriate clothes and doing my
          makeup. Even when I don't feel great, I feel better after I get dressed for the day.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Move my body</b>. Common exercise advice targets men and suggests running and push-ups.
          For most women, running requires a sports bra, and push-ups are harder. I like walking,
          biking, and climbing. Try different types of fitness to see what you like.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Go on walks</b>.
          <ul>
            <li>
              I have a step goal to walk 6000 steps a day (about 2.5 miles). Walking is good mild
              exercise.
            </li>
            <li>I listen to audiobooks, music, or podcasts while I walk.</li>
            <li>
              I like going outside. Walking past outdoor cafes, the local produce store, and the cat
              in the clock shop makes me smile.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Eat enough food</b>.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Bodies need fuel. I used to have
              <a href="https://www.elainewlin.com/writing/life/why_im_vegan.html" target="_blank"
                >an unhealthy relationship with food</a
              >
              so I sometimes remind myself to eat enough food.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bodies know how much to eat. I follow
              <a href="https://www.abbeyskitchen.com/reject-the-diet-mentality/" target="_blank"
                >intuitive eating</a
              >: eat when hungry and stop when full.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Pay attention while eating.</b> I focus on the food and don't use technology.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Rest my eyeballs.</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Screens dry out eyeballs. I have a Mac extension
              <a

                >Take a Break</a

              that reminds me to look away from my computer.
            </li>
            <li>
              Blue light is maybe bad for you. I downloaded
              <a href="https://justgetflux.com/" target="_blank">flux</a> to make my screen orange
              and less bright.

        News, social media, and notifications stress me out, so I remain out of the loop. Here's how
        I configure my technology:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Silence my smartphone.</b>
          <ul>
            <li>I say no when apps ask if they can send me notifications.</li>
            <li>I turn off sounds for text messages because they aren't urgent.</li>
            <li>Phone calls do still ring for urgent issues.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Delete news, email, and social media apps.</b> I'm more pleased after I got rid of
          Gmail and Instagram on my phone.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Log out of sites.</b> Facebook asks if I want to save my login information. No. Logging
          out deters me from mindlessly checking social media.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Block social media home screens.</b> I downloaded a
          <a

          Chrome extension.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Health advice recommends meditation. Here's how I approach meditation:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Rethink meditation as <a href="#footnote-1" id="inline-footnote-1">do nothing</a>.</b>
          Meditation often sounds effortful and hard, but doing nothing feels more approachable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Pay attention to 1 breath.</b> Feel how the body expands when you breathe in. Feel how
          the body collapses when you breathe out.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Meditate for 1-3 minutes.</b>
          <a href="https://www.headspace.com/" target="_blank">Headspace</a> has a short breath
          meditation that helps me recenter.

        When it comes to technology usage, I treat myself like a small child. I don't trust my
        willpower. Instead, I have automated tools to limit my technology usage and turn off tech at

          <b>Write down all tasks.</b>
          <ul>

              Use an electronic to-do list. I use
              <a href="https://todoist.com/app/" target="_blank">Todoist</a>. This helps you track
              tasks across different devices or when you're on the go.
            </li>
            <li>Keep pen and paper handy. As they come up, jot down action items from meetings.</li>

        <li>
          <b>Maintain a calendar.</b> This helps you track meetings with other humans and schedule

        <li>
          <b>Break down tasks.</b> What is the actionable next step? For example, the first in doing
          your taxes is to find your paperwork.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Batch related tasks.</b> This reduces the overhead of context switching. I batch

        Knowing something is good for you doesn't mean that you'll do it. Sensible advice like "get
        enough sleep" and "exercise" is often hard to follow. This piece listed concrete ways to
        achieve peaceful productivity. I hope you try out a new process, reflect, and adapt it to
        your life.
