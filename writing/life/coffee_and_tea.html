        You don't need a fancy setup to make coffee or tea at home. In this piece, I share my home
        coffee and tea setup so you can enjoy your daily caffeine fix or a cozy hot drink. The setup
        is:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Basic - The tools are easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
        <li>Budget - Everything is <=$30 as of June 2021.</li>
        <li>Small - I live in an apartment and don't have space for large gadgets.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Here's an outline. In each section, I include more info and references if you want to be
        fancier.

        I'm not picky about coffee. Thinking about coffee quality reminds me of
        <a href="http://en.ilovecoffee.jp/posts/view/71" target="_blank">this comic</a>. If you take
        coffee with milk or sugar, it can obscure the finer details. I always have coffee with plant
        milk, so it's harder to tell the nuances of light or dark roast, bean origin, or brewing
        method.

              Don't pour coffee grounds down the sink. I did, and it broke the garbage disposal. The

              coffee and spices unless you want your coffee to taste like cumin.

      <h2 class="text-large" id="tea">tea</h2>
      <p>
        To make tea, put tea in hot water, wait, remove the tea, and drink. The package of tea will
        have more detailed instructions. If you want to better understand tea, you can look at a few
        factors in the process:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Type of tea:</b> Did you know green, oolong, and black teas all come from
          <a href="https://www.samovartea.com/how-tea-is-made/" target="_blank">the same plant</a>?
          They only differ in the level of oxidation - how bruised the leaves are. Green teas are
          less oxidized and have fresher, grassy flavors while black teas are more oxidized and have
          toastier flavors. Teas made from other plants (i.e. chamomile, rooibos) are herbal teas.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Water temperature:</b> Different types of tea taste better when steeped at different
          temperatures. For example, if you use boiling water for green tea, then it can taste
          bitter or burnt. You can measure water temperature, or you can eyeball the kettle.
          <a
            href="https://www.goldenmoontea.com/blogs/tea/106687623-the-5-different-stages-of-boiling-water-and-how-the-chinese-use-them-for-tea"
            target="_blank"
            >Here</a
          >
          is a guide to what water looks like at different temperatures.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Steep time:</b> Teas have different steep times. For example, herbal tea can have a
          longer steep time (7-10 minutes) than green or black tea (3 minutes).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Tea bag vs. loose leaf:</b> You can buy chopped up tea leaves in tea bags or whole,
          loose leaf tea. Loose leaf tea tastes fresher, but requires more work to filter out the
          tea leaves. I recommend using a
          <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B001713L84" target="_blank">mini strainer</a>
          to do so.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Ratio of tea to water:</b> For tea bags, it suffices to use 1 tea bag and about 1 cup
          of water. If you make loose leaf tea, it helps to measure the amount of tea and water so
          you don't get a watery cup.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can brew tea in cold water, but it's more finicky. Different teas have different steep
        times. For example, leaving green tea overnight (8 hours) is too long and results in a
        bitter cup. If you want iced tea, steep in a small amount (~1/4 cup) of hot water so your
        drink doesn't get diluted. Then, pour over ice.
      </p>

            minutes.

            is ground up green tea that you dissolve in water. To make matcha, first add a tiny

              is good for measuring coffee or loose leaf tea. Measuring by weight is more precise
              than measuring by volume - volume varies depending on the coffee grind or tea leaf
              density.
            </p>

              A scale is also good for baking. When baking, it's less messy to measure ingredients
              by weight since you don't have to clean so many measuring cups.

            is nice to have if you like fluffy drinks. To use:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Microwave a small amount (~1/4 cup) of plant milk for 30 seconds. The liquid expands
                a lot, so only use a small amount.
              </li>
              <li>Froth.</li>
              <li>Pour on top of your drink.</li>
            </ol>

        There is no ideal coffee and tea setup, just one that works for you. The main requirements
        are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Easy to use:</b> When I visited my parents, I tried to make a cup of tea. It took me a
          few minutes to figure out how to boil water in the electric kettle - it only worked if you
          pressed a specific spot. I bought my parents a new kettle.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Brings you joy:</b> I like the process of making coffee or tea. My kettle has a
          soothing blue light. I'm chuffed with my snowman milk frother - it's adorable and
          practical.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>How do you feel about your coffee and tea setup? Is there anyhting you want to upgrade?</p>
