      <h2>
        Your job doesn't have to be your passion
      </h2>
      <p>
        At the start of my career, I felt boring and unambitious for wanting to work a 9-to-5 as a software engineer. The ideal job seemed passionate and exciting: Start your own business! Look at this shiny startup! Change the world! However, over time, I learned that your job doesn't have to be your passion.
      </p>
      <p>
         A passionate job isn't for me. Your job should suit your personality and interests. Starting a business requires more risk tolerance and optimistic chutzpah than I have. I prefer to save my money for a rainy day than to invest it in a venture that might not work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Doing something you love for money can make it a chore. If you want to get paid, there's always someone to please: your boss, your audience, or your clients. For example, I love cooking and playing music, but wouldn't want to do either as a job <sup>(1)</sup>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A 9-to-5 job isn't inherently boring or unpleasant. Think of it like walking the same loop everyday. You can stare at your feet. Or, you can notice new flowers and faces. Sometimes, it's clear and sunny. Other days, it's rainy and blustery. You can enjoy the walk regardless of the weather.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can like a job for practical reasons. It doesn't need to be 100% aligned with your interests <sup>(2)</sup>.<br>Here's what I look for in a job:
        <ol>
          <li>Reasonable working hours. I don't want to work long hours - <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6617405/" target="_blank">it's inefficient anyways</a>.</li>
          <li>Enjoyable. I need to like the day-to-day work and who I work with.</li>
          <li>Stable. The company is not going to go kaput in a few weeks.</li>
          <li>Good for learning. I want to learn new skills and get better at my job.</li>
          <li>Pays well. I want to be paid fairly for my skill set. I need enough money to pay rent and buy food.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        Whose job do you want? Answering this question can help you figure out what you want from work. Growing up, I saw my mom working as a software engineer and thought her job looked great. Now, I share her quiet respect and enjoyment for the work.

      <p>Beverley Cheng's post <a href="https://borntosweat.co/blog/job-doesnt-passion-thats-ok/" target="_blank">Your Job Doesn’t Have to Be Your Passion, and That’s OK</a> inspired me to write this. I first read her post back in college, and I found her outlook very refreshing.</p>
      <p>
        (1) Here are jobs in cooking and music I considered and didn't pursue:
        <ul>
          <li>Cook - I don't want to work long hours or to please palates.</li>
          <li>Food blogger - I don't like doing food photography.</li>
          <li>Musician, music teacher - I don't want to play gigs. I want to learn songs at my own whim.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        (2) In software, you can work in many different industries and applications. I love cooking and music, but don't need to work in food tech or music tech. I'm happy as long as the software company is good for the world and aligned with my moral values:
        <ul>
          <li>I've worked on restaurant and financial products.</li>
          <li><a href="/writing/life/why_im_vegan.html" target="_blank">I'm vegan</a>, so I wouldn't work for a meat company.</li>
        </ul>
