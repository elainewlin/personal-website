        <li>
          Currently, I am a staff software engineer at Figma in the AI pillar. At Figma, I led
          multiple work streams to launch the actions menu with new AI features and the UI redesign
          at Config 2024.
        </li>
        <li>
          I have 7+ years of experience with software development - I’ve worked as a full stack
          software engineer since 2017.
        </li>
        <li>
          I graduated from MIT in 3 years. I majored in computer science and did a HASS (humanities,
          arts, and social sciences) concentration in linguistics.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="text-large" id="#referral">Can you refer me to Figma?</h2>
      <p>
        When I was younger, I felt intimidated asking people for job referrals. But, it turns out
        that if they hire you, then I get 很多钱, commonly called a referral bonus. See Figma job
        openings <a href="https://www.figma.com/careers/#job-openings" target="_blank">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you would like a referral, please email me your resume, a link to the role you are
        interested in, and a short blurb on why you’re a good fit for the role. You do not need to
        also apply for the role - the referral is your application. Note that you do not have to
        meet every single requirement to be qualified for a role.

        If you have at least a little bit of experience working as a software engineer (i.e.
        completed one software internship, just started working fulltime), I am happy to help you

        My email is this domain name, elainewlin, at Gmail. If I am terse in replying, it’s often
        because I only have one paw free for typing. If I am slow in replying, it’s likely because I
        do not check my email that often.
